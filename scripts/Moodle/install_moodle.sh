# Installs Moodle.
#
# Note, that this script must be executed as superuser with:
#   sudo sh install_moodle.sh <name> <repository> <password> <php_version>
#     <admin_password> <opencast_port> <force_yes>
#
# name:             The name of the Moodle installation.
# repository:       The name of the repository for the Moodle installation.
# password:         The password of the Moodle user for the database.
# php_version:      The version of PHP, that is used for the installation (e.g., 7.4).
# admin_password:   The password of the admin account with the name admin of the Moodle installation.
# opencast_port:    The port, at which Opencast is reachable.
# force_yes:        Optional parameter, that can be passed.
#                   If force_yes is passed for this parameter, the script will be executed without
#                   a confirmation by the user.
#                   If another value is passed for this parameter, this parameter is ignored.
#
# Note, that the source of the Moodle version must be included in the directory and
# that this Moodle version is installed:
#   /var/www/html/<name>/<repository>
#
# Note, that the database with the name <name> and the Moodle user
# <name>_user for the database as well as the Moodle data directory
# /etc/moodle/<name> will be created and used.
# In addition, the config file will be created in the directory:
#   /var/www/html/<name>/<repository>
