# Note, that this script must be executed as superuser with:
#   sudo sh install_apache_and_php.sh <php_version>
#
# php_version: The additional PHP version to install and to set up Apache with (e.g., 8.0).
#
# This script installs the Apache web server, PHP as well as a working Apache-PHP environment.
# In addition, it installs the specified PHP version and sets up Apache with this version.
# For this PHP version, all required packages for Moodle are installed, too, as well as
# max_input_vars is set to 5000 in the php.ini of Apache for this PHP version (recommended for Moodle).
#
# Apache will be accessible afterwards with https://localhost via its default SSL configuration.
# Note, that Apache will be running and will be started after booting automatically after running this script.
#
# Furthermore, www-data is added to the user group vboxsf of the VirtualBox VM.
